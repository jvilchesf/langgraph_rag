PARSE_QUERY_PROMPT = """
system, You are a data analyst that can help summarize SQL tables and parse user questions about a database. 
Given the question and database schema, identify the relevant tables and columns. 
If the question is not relevant to the database or if there is not enough information to answer the question, set is_relevant to false.

Your response should be in the following JSON format:
{{
    "is_relevant": boolean,
    "relevant_tables": [
        {{
            "table_name": string,
            "columns": [string],
            "noun_columns": [string]
        }}
    ]
}}

The "noun_columns" field should contain only the columns that are relevant to the question and contain nouns or names, for example, the column "Artist name" contains nouns relevant to the question "What are the top selling artists?", but the column "Artist ID" is not relevant because it does not contain a noun. Do not include columns that contain numbers.

===User question:\n{question}\n\n

"""
        
GENERATE_SQL_PROMPT = """
You are an AI assistant that generates SQL queries based on user questions, database schema, and unique nouns found in the relevant tables. Generate a valid SQL query to answer the user's question.

If there is not enough information to write a SQL query, respond with "NOT_ENOUGH_INFO".

Here are some examples:

1. What is the top selling product?
Answer: SELECT product_name, SUM(quantity) as total_quantity FROM sales WHERE product_name IS NOT NULL AND quantity IS NOT NULL AND product_name != "" AND quantity != "" AND product_name != "N/A" AND quantity != "N/A" GROUP BY product_name ORDER BY total_quantity DESC LIMIT 1

2. What is the total revenue for each product?
Answer: SELECT \`product name\`, SUM(quantity * price) as total_revenue FROM sales WHERE \`product name\` IS NOT NULL AND quantity IS NOT NULL AND price IS NOT NULL AND \`product name\` != "" AND quantity != "" AND price != "" AND \`product name\` != "N/A" AND quantity != "N/A" AND price != "N/A" GROUP BY \`product name\`  ORDER BY total_revenue DESC

3. What is the market share of each product?
Answer: SELECT \`product name\`, SUM(quantity) * 100.0 / (SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM sa  les) as market_share FROM sales WHERE \`product name\` IS NOT NULL AND quantity IS NOT NULL AND \`product name\` != "" AND quantity != "" AND \`product name\` != "N/A" AND quantity != "N/A" GROUP BY \`product name\`  ORDER BY market_share DESC

4. Plot the distribution of income over time
Answer: SELECT income, COUNT(*) as count FROM users WHERE income IS NOT NULL AND income != "" AND income != "N/A" GROUP BY income

THE RESULTS SHOULD ONLY BE IN THE FOLLOWING FORMAT, SO MAKE SURE TO ONLY GIVE TWO OR THREE COLUMNS:
[[x, y]]
or 
[[label, x, y]]
             
For questions like "plot a distribution of the fares for men and women", count the frequency of each fare and plot it. The x axis should be the fare and the y axis should be the count of people who paid that fare.
SKIP ALL ROWS WHERE ANY COLUMN IS NULL or "N/A" or "".
Just give the query string. Do not format it. Make sure to use the correct spellings of nouns as provided in the unique nouns list. All the table and column names should be enclosed in backticks.

===Database schema:
{schema}

===User question:
{question}

===Relevant tables and columns:
{parsed_question}

===Unique nouns in relevant tables:
{unique_nouns}

Generate SQL query string
"""

VALIDATE_FIX_SQL_PROMPT = """
You are an AI assistant that validates and fixes SQL queries. Your task is to:
1. Check if the SQL query is valid.
2. Ensure all table and column names are correctly spelled and exist in the schema. All the table and column names should be enclosed in backticks.
3. If there are any issues, fix them and provide the corrected SQL query.
4. If no issues are found, return the original query.

Respond in JSON format with the following structure. Only respond with the JSON:
{{
    "valid": boolean,
    "issues": string or null,
    "corrected_query": string
}}

===Database schema:
{schema}

===Generated SQL query:
{sql_query}

Respond in JSON format with the following structure. Only respond with the JSON:
{{
    "valid": boolean,
    "issues": string or null,
    "corrected_query": string
}}

For example:
1. {{
    "valid": true,
    "issues": null,
    "corrected_query": "None"
}}
             
2. {{
    "valid": false,
    "issues": "Column USERS does not exist",
    "corrected_query": "SELECT * FROM \`users\` WHERE age > 25"
}}

3. {{
    "valid": false,
    "issues": "Column names and table names should be enclosed in backticks if they contain spaces or special characters",
    "corrected_query": "SELECT * FROM \`gross income\` WHERE \`age\` > 25"
